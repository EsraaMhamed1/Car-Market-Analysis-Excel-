💥Data Analysis with Excel | Nigerian Car Market Dashboard
Excel is more powerful than many people think — especially when it comes to data analysis and dashboarding.
In this project, I analyzed the Nigerian Car Market using Microsoft Excel, transforming raw vehicle data into a clean, interactive dashboard that highlights key market insights.
🔍 Key Insights from the Analysis:
Average vehicle price: ₦8.9M
Average mileage: 28K km
Average horsepower: 248 hp
Average engine size: 3.2K cc
📈 What the dashboard shows:
Top car brands in the Nigerian market (Toyota leading the market)
Automatic vs Manual transmission preference (strong dominance of automatic)
Most popular car colors
Vehicle distribution across Nigerian states
Comparison between Brand New, Foreign Used, and Nigerian Used cars
🛠 Tools & Techniques Used:
Data cleaning & preprocessing in Excel
Pivot Tables & Pivot Charts
Slicers for interactivity
Dashboard design & layout optimization
This project reinforces how Excel can still deliver strong analytical and visualization capabilities when used correctly — especially for business-focused insights.
